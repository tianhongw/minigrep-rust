*** Grep project will combine a number of concepts youâ€™ve learned so far:

- Organizing code (using what you learned about modules in Chapter 7)
- Using vectors and strings (collections, Chapter 8)
- Handling errors (Chapter 9)
- Using traits and lifetimes where appropriate (Chapter 10)
- Writing tests (Chapter 11)
